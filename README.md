## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages

## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- Clerk
- Tailwind CSS
- drizzle
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to better handle svgs in nextjs, and use clerk & clerkElements to handle auth flow in nextjs.

### Continued development

I would like to make the images used correspond to the size of the card. I'd also like to add loading skeletons to the cards.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Creator showing how to use svgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbUyHQRq2go&list=PL7CcGwsqRpSM3w9BT_21tUU8JN2SnyckR&index=12) - This helped me understand how to use svgs in tailwind
